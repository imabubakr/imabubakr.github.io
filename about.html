      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>II grew up in Islamabad, Pakistan, with a deep love for the natural world. Pursuing my passion, I enrolled in a Bachelor's degree program in geology and during my final year, I was introduced to GIS and Remote Sensing, which sparked my interest in the field. After completing my Bachelor's degree, I decided to pursue a Master's degree in GIS and Remote Sensing. While pursuing my master's, I undertook a range of GIS academic projects, and concurrently, worked part-time as a GIS analyst to apply my learning to real-world scenarios.</p>
      <p>Later, I was presented with an opportunity to pursue a Master's degree in Geology at the University of Freiburg in Germany. Intrigued by the idea of studying in a new country, I accepted the challenge. During my time in Freiburg, I fully immersed myself in the local culture and continued to apply my knowledge of remote sensing applications to geology, enhancing my understanding of the subject. After completing my Master's degree in Geology, I went on to finish my Master's thesis in GIS and Remote Sensing, solidifying my expertise in the field.</p>
      <p>Today, I am a highly skilled professional with a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Geology, as well as a Master's degree in GIS and Remote Sensing. I have worked on a variety of projects, using my skills and expertise to make a positive impact in the field of geospatial data analysis.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring the beautiful landscape of the Black Forest, indulging in local cuisines, and learning new language. With my passion and expertise for GIS and Remote Sensing, I am always eager to learn and take on new challenges as they arise, continuing to make a difference in the world. </p>
