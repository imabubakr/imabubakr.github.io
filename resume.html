            <h3>GIS Specialist, MapTransfer</h3>
            <p>Oct 2022 - May 2023 </p>
            <p>As a member of the Spatial Data Management project for a construction company, I am responsible for tasks including georeferencing maps, merging orthophoto tiles, generating cloud-optimized GeoTIFFs, and importing and managing vector data in PostGIS. These tasks require a strong foundation in geospatial data management and analysis, and I am committed to delivering high-quality work on time. Additionally, I have developed a basic web GIS application as part of my contributions to the project. This application efficiently retrieves vector layers from PostGIS using Geoserver's WMS format and presents them in OpenLayers for intuitive web-based viewing.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>GIS Trainer, MapTransfer</h3>
            <p>Apr 2021 - March 2023 </p>
            <p>In my role as a GIS trainer, I have had the opportunity to deliver a variety of in-house courses, including LiDAR Data in QGIS, Spatial Data Analysis, Spatial SQL and Geoserver. I have also been involved in the collaborative development of these courses. My work as a trainer has given me the chance to share my skills and knowledge with others, and I am committed to staying current in my field and continually improving my abilities.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>GIS Specialist, Freelance</h3>
            <p>Aug 2021 - March 2023 </p>
            <p>As a Fiber Optic Documentation Specialist, I was responsible for field data processing using QGIS. My responsibilities included converting CSV files into various shapefile components, digitizing data, and creating visual representations of fiber optic networks, also known as fiber maps. I utilized a variety of QGIS tools, such as the Vector, Raster, and Data Management toolbars, to effectively manage and analyze field data. I also gained experience with maintaining digital records of all network components in a geopackage.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>GIS Analyst, Pakland Builders</h3>
            <p>Feb 2016 - Aug 2017 </p>
            <p>In this role, I was responsible for georeferencing survey maps and satellite imagery to verify property lines using ArcGIS. I also digitized features and performed various GIS operations, including generating raster maps and assisting with vector data management in PostGIS, a spatial database management system. Additionally, I published rasters as WMS (Web Map Service) layers for web viewing and dissemination.</p>

            <h3>Glacier Mass Balance</h3>
            <p>During my geological project, I employed a range of datasets such as old historical imageries, Landsat 5, 7 and 8, Sentinel 2, and DEMs to examine the mass balance of Mýrdalsjökull and its sublet glaciers over the past four decades. At first, band ratios were utilized for snow index calculations, but the outcomes proved to be insufficient. To address this, the main glacier and its sublet glaciers were manually digitized for different years and their respective areas and volumes were calculated. Through our analysis, we observed a twofold increase in the melting rate after the year 2000, indicating a considerable impact of climate change on the glacier. This project provided me with a more comprehensive understanding of the significance of geospatial data analysis in monitoring and responding to the effects of climate change.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Snow Cover and Precipitation Quantification</h3>
            <p>As part of my semester research work, I utilized MODIS and TRMM datasets to quantify snow cover and average precipitation between the years 2000 and 2015. The normalized snow index derived from MODIS data was used to estimate the snow cover, while the average rainfall was determined by converting the monthly product of TRMM from mm/h to mm/month. Although no significant change was observed in the snow cover initially, a gradual decrease was noted in the last 3-4 years, possibly due to changes in snow accumulation periods. Moreover, the rainfall data showed variations, with lower precipitation levels in the early years and the highest levels recorded in 2010. This project not only allowed me to enhance my skills in GIS data analysis but also highlighted the importance of monitoring climate-related phenomena to address the challenges posed by climate change.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Hydrological Modeling</h3>
            <p>I utilized Landsat 7 data spanning six years to calculate the snow index for every three-month period and track changes in snow cover area over time. This project helped me develop my skills in remote sensing and provided me with valuable insights into the importance of snowpack monitoring in water resource management.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Mapping Volcanic Terrain</h3>
            <p>In my mapping volcanic terrain project, I utilized Landsat 8 and ASTER DEM datasets to analyze the volcanic landcover, erosion, symmetry, morphometry, and growth rate of Mauna Kea. The Landsat 8 dataset was used to create a landcover map of the volcano, while the ASTER DEM dataset was used to analyze the terrain morphology and assess the growth rate of the volcano. Through this project, I was able to gain expertise in remote sensing and GIS analysis techniques, and developed a deeper understanding of the geological processes that shape volcanic landscapes.</p>
